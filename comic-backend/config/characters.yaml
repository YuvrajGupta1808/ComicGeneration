    name: Commander Eva Rostova
    description: Commander Rostova is a seasoned astronaut in her late 30s, with a lean, athletic build honed by years of
      rigorous training. Her utilitarian spacesuit is clearly well-worn, bearing scuffs and signs of environmental wear,
      hinting at a long and arduous journey. Despite the fatigue evident in her posture and the faint internal glow
      suggesting low power, her helmet's visor reflects a resolute determination. Rostova's face, glimpsed through the
      visor, conveys a mixture of awe and dawning hope as she interacts with the alien flora, her gloved hands
      exhibiting gentle curiosity.

    name: Lumena
    description: Lumena is a small, spherical drone, approximately the size of a basketball, with a polished metallic shell
      that gleams with reflected light. Its form is sleek and functional, designed for observation and assistance, with
      no discernible appendages beyond a discreet array of optical sensors. Lumena hovers attentively, its multifaceted
      sensors intently focused on the bioluminescent plants, its entire being radiating an air of quiet, analytical
      competence. The drone's metallic surface captures the vibrant emerald and azure hues of the grove, making it a
      dynamic part of the glowing sanctuary.
