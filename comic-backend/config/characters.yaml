    name: Leo Vance
    description: Leo is a charming baker in his late twenties, with a strong, capable build honed by his profession. Flour
      dust often settles on his practical apron, hinting at his dedication to his craft, and a serene concentration is
      his usual expression when working. His hands are skilled, capable of the delicate placement of a macaron or the
      precise lines of a cake, and his brow can furrow, showing a thoughtful, inquisitive nature when faced with the
      unexpected. His overall appearance radiates warmth and competence, a true craftsman at heart.

    name: Elara Meadow
    description: Elara is a shy bookworm in her early twenties, characterized by her kind, expressive eyes and a tendency to
      clutch a book to her chest as a shield. A perpetual soft blush often graces her cheeks, especially when she's
      feeling observed or vulnerable. Her build is slender, and her movements are often hesitant, peeking from behind
      book shelves with a quiet grace. Her style is understated and comfortable, prioritizing practicality for browsing
      books, and her overall demeanor suggests a gentle soul with a rich inner world.
