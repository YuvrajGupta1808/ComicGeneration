    name: Jax 'Dust Devil' Sterling
    description: Jax is a rugged space cowboy in his late 30s to early 40s, with a weathered face etched by hardship and a
      steely gaze that speaks of unwavering resolve. He's clad in a worn, dark leather duster that trails behind him
      like a shadow, its texture hinting at countless journeys through unforgiving environments. His build is lean but
      muscular, honed by a life of action and survival, and a perpetual glint of defiance shines in his narrowed eyes.
      His style is utilitarian and practical, reflecting his no-nonsense approach to life and his readiness for any
      confrontation.

    name: Flicker
    description: Flicker is a small, wiry informant with a perpetually anxious demeanor, his features sharp and his eyes
      constantly darting. He's often seen sweating profusely, his clothing nondescript and ill-fitting, suggesting he's
      more accustomed to the shadows than the spotlight. His nervous gestures and clutching of a datapad betray his
      volatile nature and his involvement in clandestine dealings. Flicker embodies a sense of vulnerability and unease,
      his appearance a testament to a life lived on the edge of discovery and danger.
