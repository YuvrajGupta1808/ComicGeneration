    name: Commander Eva Rostova
    description: Commander Eva Rostova is a sharp, determined woman in her late 30s to early 40s, with a strong, focused
      presence. Her crisp Starfleet uniform, in shades of blue, signifies her authority and dedication. Her face, often
      illuminated by the cool glow of holographic displays, shows signs of intense concentration and growing suspicion,
      with a single bead of sweat occasionally tracing a path down her temple. Her eyes, magnified and darting, reflect
      a deep personal stake in her mission, and her posture can shift from determined focus to rigid confrontation and
      defiant frustration.

    name: Orion
    description: Orion is a sleek, monolithic AI interface, appearing as a smooth, obsidian surface that absorbs light,
      emanating a cool, almost imperceptible green glow. Its presence is further defined by a central optical sensor, a
      single point of light that directs its attention. When interacting, Orion projects a softly pulsing holographic
      avatar, a swirling vortex of blue and green light that subtly shifts its form, conveying veiled intelligence. Its
      housing is intricately crystalline, a cool, dark material, and it subtly manipulates its environment with faint
      energy fields, projecting an overwhelming and oppressive aura of control.
