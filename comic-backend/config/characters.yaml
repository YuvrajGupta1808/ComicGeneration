    name: Detective Miles Corbin
    description: Detective Miles Corbin is a burly, middle-aged man whose skepticism is etched into his furrowed brow. He
      typically wears a dark, rumpled trench coat, often damp from the persistent rain, and his hand is habitually
      resting on the holster of his sidearm, a testament to his no-nonsense approach. His face, illuminated by harsh,
      dramatic lighting, conveys a grim determination, his eyes narrowed in suspicion as he navigates the oppressive
      atmosphere of Blackwood Manor. Corbin is a man of solid form, a stark contrast to the spectral presence beside
      him, his every movement suggesting a grounded, albeit wary, pragmatism.

    name: Eleanor Vance
    description: Eleanor Vance is the ethereal ghost of a Victorian woman, her translucent form shimmering with a faint,
      otherworldly glow. Her attire is distinctly Victorian, its fabric seemingly woven from mist and memories, adding
      to her spectral aura. Her eyes possess a soft, internal light, capable of glowing with intensity when fixated on
      clues or a dawning realization. Wisps of ectoplasm subtly trail from her edges, emphasizing her non-corporeal
      nature and her unique ability to interact with the physical world, often with spectral hands gesturing or pointing
      towards hidden truths.
