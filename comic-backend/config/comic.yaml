    description: Leo is a curious and energetic boy, appearing to be around 9-10 years old. He has a bright blue t-shirt
      that stands out against his sun-kissed skin, and his hair is likely a tousled mess from his energetic pursuits.
      His eyes often hold a look of wonder or mild panic, as seen when he glances back or stumbles slightly during their
      chase.  He's often depicted in motion, arms flailing a bit, suggesting an earnest but sometimes clumsy enthusiasm
      for the adventure.

    description: Mia is a determined and focused girl, around the same age as Leo. She wears a cheerful yellow sundress, a
      stark contrast to the serious expressions she sometimes displays. Her gaze is often directed upwards with
      unwavering resolve, her jaw set with a hint of desperation and a flicker of awe.  A strand of sweat often trickles
      down her temple, showcasing her physical exertion and commitment to their quest. Her body language, whether
      pointing or reaching out, conveys a strong sense of purpose and an unyielding spirit.

      with a bright blue t-shirt, and Mia, a determined girl in a yellow sundress, are mid-chase, their faces etched
      with surprise and urgency. Their colorful kite, a red diamond with a long, trailing tail, is just starting to
      ascend beyond the frame, pulled by an unseen force. The lighting is bright and natural, casting gentle shadows on
      the manicured grass, creating a cheerful yet slightly anxious mood.
