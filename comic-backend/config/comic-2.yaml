    description: Elara is a young, determined astronaut in her early twenties, with a lean and athletic build honed by
      rigorous training. Her face, visible through her helmet visor, is often etched with a mix of fierce concentration
      and overwhelming panic, her wide eyes reflecting the vastness and terror of space. Her standard-issue, white EVA
      suit is utilitarian and functional, showing signs of wear and tear from her desperate struggle, with scuff marks
      and slightly frayed edges that speak to her ordeal. Her movements, initially fumbling and desperate, become
      precise and focused when faced with a challenge, showcasing her resilience and quick thinking under extreme
      pressure.

    description: This isn't a sentient character, but a significant object personified through its description. The 'Echo'
      satellite is an aged, derelict piece of spacefaring history, its metallic paneling scarred, rusted, and pockmarked
      from years adrift. Despite its worn exterior, a faint, persistent amber glow emanates from its central antenna,
      hinting at dormant power and a flicker of hope. Its form is sprawling and complex, a stark contrast to the sleek,
      modern station, with exposed circuitry and tangled wires that Elara meticulously works on, giving it a fragile yet
      determined presence.

      and external modules, dominates the middle ground. The background is a deep, inky black, punctuated by distant,
      pinprick stars and the faint, curved horizon of a distant planet, establishing a sense of isolation and awe.
