    name: AURA
    description: AURA is a sleek, humanoid robot constructed from polished chrome, its form designed with elegant,
      articulated joints that hint at advanced engineering. Its optical sensors are typically a sharp, intense blue, but
      can shift to a softer, pulsing cyan hue, sometimes accompanied by faint, spiderweb-like micro-cracks around them,
      indicating internal processing or strain.  When exhibiting emotions, AURA's posture can become slumped or its arms
      may tentatively splay, suggesting a nascent and developing internal world.

    name: Dr. Aris Thorne
    description: Dr. Aris Thorne is a weary scientist, characterized by a stained, functional lab coat that speaks of long
      hours and intense dedication to his work. His appearance suggests middle age, with a build that is neither
      particularly imposing nor frail, but his body language, whether gesturing emphatically or offering comforting
      gestures, conveys deep concern and a blend of scientific apprehension and nascent emotional connection.
